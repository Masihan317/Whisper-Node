# Whisper-Node

### Introduction
This project is a full-stack Instagram web clone built using the MERN tech stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS). Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Daisy UI are used for frontend development, while Zustand is used for state management. Additionally, Custom hooks are written using existing React hooks to help supplement the needed functionality. SocketIO is used to make the chat application real time, allowing users to receive messages without refreshing the page.

### Features
- **Sign up and Login**: Users can sign up for an account using their email and password.
- **Search Users**: Users can search for a specific user with a search bar.
- **Real Time Chat**: Users can send and receive messages in a real time manner from other users registered on the website. <3
